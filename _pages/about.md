I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the [University of Mohaghegh Ardabili](https://uma.ac.ir). Before joining the University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, I was a Research Member at the [Young Researchers and Elite Club](https://bpj.ir/index_e.aspx) in Ardabil, Iran.

I got my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Tabriz](https://tabrizu.ac.ir/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Mahrdad Lakestani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UR2VEoQAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2017.
